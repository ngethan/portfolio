                    This unit was extremely beneficial in improving my writing
                    skills. I learned many techniques from utilizing a lot of
                    imagery that describes the five senses, using hooptedoodle,
                    and using proofs to give me authority as a writer. I&apos;m
                    delighted with what I came up with this unit and I think it
                    outlines my journey with something I&apos;m passionate about
                    quite well. Also, reading food memoirs was particularly
                    beneficial for inspiration and seeing what techniques people
                    utilized in their food memoirs – humor and dialogue for
                    example.

                    <br />I learned how to take a seemingly elementary topic –
                    bacon, egg, and cheese – and expand on it. I found meaning
                    in the ordinary and extracted a profound lesson from it.

                    Reflections on the Pursuit of Perfection
                </h1>
                <p className="text-gray-100">
                    &emsp;The year is 2012. The corinthian bells chime as I
                    heave and pull at the door of Panera Bread. My mother comes
                    up behind me and effortlessly opens the door, revealing what
                    I would soon call my second home. I tentatively approach the
                    counter, still overwhelmed by the smell of coffee and
                    freshly baked bread, and the sounds of spoons clinking
                    against bowls and ovens whirring. I stare in awe at the
                    colossal mounted TVs, displaying Panera Bread&apos;s
                    plethora of food options. As my parents and siblings started
                    ordering, I frantically skimmed the menu, desperately
                    looking for something I&apos;d like. “And for you?” asked
                    the cashier. I looked up.
                    <br />
                    <i>&emsp;Is she talking to me?</i>
                    <br />
                    &emsp;Finally, I settled on what looked most appetizing – a
                    bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. My family meandered towards
                    the tables, settling on one in the corner. My dad retrieved
                    our food once it was ready and set it down. I was awestruck
                    by what was placed before me. My eyes take a moment to
                    admire the glorious concoction – its vibrant colors dancing
                    across my eyes. I snap out of it quickly. As I bring it to
                    my mouth, I&apos;m blessed by the aroma of sharp cheddar,
                    smoky bacon, and buttery bread. My teeth penetrate the
                    bagel&apos;s hard exterior and reveal the ineffably soft
                    insides. Next comes the crunchy bacon, then the runny eggs,
                    the melted cheese, and last but not least – the bottom
                    bagel. Its rich flavors, diverse textures, and divine aroma
                    all worked in unison, composing a euphonious melody, and
                    playing in my head.
                    <br />
                    &emsp;For a while, I was complacent. I didn&apos;t think
                    anything could ever trump such a marvelous sandwich. But as
                    I grew older and my taste buds matured and I sampled other
                    bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches, I began to realize that
                    not all bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches were created
                    equal. I had been a fan of Panera Bread&apos;s sandwich, but
                    tasting other variations opened my eyes to the gastronomic
                    potential of the sandwich, and I began to see that
                    Panera&apos;s offering was not as good as I had thought.
                    This realization led me to start searching for the “perfect”
                    bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. I experimented with
                    Starbucks – I left sorely disappointed and $4.75 poorer.
                    “Perhaps Dunkin&apos; Donuts will be better”, I thought.
                    Alas, the bacon was not crispy enough — the egg was an
                    unseasoned slab of sadness. The cheese wasn&apos;t even
                    melted.
                    <br />
                    &emsp;The thought of bacon, egg, and cheese plagued my mind
                    and consumed me. I traveled from Stuyvesant to the Lower
                    East Side to Midtown West. As I walked through the bustling
                    streets of New York City, the cacophony of sounds that
                    surrounded me slowly became familiar and comforting - the
                    honking of car horns, the chatter of people rushing to their
                    next destination, the clanging of construction, the sirens
                    of emergency vehicles, and the hum of the subway all blended
                    together into a rhythmic symphony that I had come to know
                    and love as the sound of the city. I tried classic diners,
                    trendy brunch spots, and even fancy restaurants that claimed
                    to have the best bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich in the
                    city. I sampled different types of bread, from English
                    muffins to brioches to croissants (my personal favorite).
                    Eventually, I realized that my satisfaction dwindled with
                    each additional bacon, egg, and cheese I ate.
                    <br />
                    &emsp;And finally, it dawned on me: the pursuit of
                    perfection is futile. No matter how strenuously I searched,
                    I would never find the perfect bacon, egg, and cheese
                    sandwich. My quest was doomed from the start. But that
                    realization was liberating. I came to understand that it is
                    not about discovering the perfect sandwich, but rather about
                    relishing the journey and savoring every bite of the
                    sandwich that I was consuming at that moment. And so I
                    abandoned my quest for the perfect bacon, egg, and cheese
                    sandwich and instead focused on enjoying the ones that I was
                    eating. And you know what? They tasted all the better for
                    it. I learned that it is not about perfection – it&apos;s
                    about cherishing the moment and relishing the journey.
